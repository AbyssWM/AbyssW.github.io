    details: Your config is a C++ file with typed options. A typo is a compile error, binds are real lambdas, and abyssctl reload rebuilds and restarts the compositor.

    title: Its own libraries
    details: The whole Hyprland stack is forked and renamed – Abyssal, Abyssutils, Abyssparse and more – so the ecosystem builds and updates as one, independent of system packages.
